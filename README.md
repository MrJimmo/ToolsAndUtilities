# Tools And Utilities
Various tools and utilities.

## [Mortgage Payments](https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/MortgagePayments/MortgagePayments.html)
A No-frills page born from wanting to generate the entire payment schedule for a loan, and produce details that matched up with the statements I get from my bank.

## [Generate Calendar](https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/GenerateCalendar/GenerateCalendar.html)
I used to get those handy little small calendars from places like Les Schwab.

I whipped this page together to generate a year in the format I like the most.  I then use a paper cutter to cut them out and then staple them to some thicker cardboard, so I end up with the current year including the holidays highlighted accurately.
