<h1>Various Tools & Utilities</h1>
Landing spot for various tools and utilities I created that either solve an actual problem or more likely was just something I created while researching, learning, or investigating some topic or area.
<p></p>

<h2>
<a href="https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/MortgagePayments/MortgagePayments.html">Mortgage Payment Calculator</a><br>
</h2>
A No-frills page born from wanting to generate the entire payment schedule for a loan, and produce details that matched up with the statements I get from my bank.
<p></p>

<h2>
<a href="https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/GenerateCalendar/GenerateCalendar.html">Generate Calendar</a><br>
</h2>
I used to get those handy little small calendars from places like Les Schwab.
<p></p>
I whipped this page together to generate a year in the format I like the most.  I then use a paper cutter to cut them out and then staple them to some thicker cardboard, so I end up with the current year including the holidays highlighted accurately.
<p></p>
Supports "year" and "horizontal" URL params.
<p></p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<a href="https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/GenerateCalendar/GenerateCalendar.html?year=2020">GenerateCalendar.html?year=2020</a> ...generates for year 2020, 4 rows x 3 columns.<br>
<a href="https://mrjimmo.com/ToolsAndUtilities/GenerateCalendar/GenerateCalendar.html?year=2021&horizontal">GenerateCalendar.html?year=2021&horizontal</a> ...generates for year 2021, 3 rows of 4 columns
